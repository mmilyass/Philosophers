threads: is a way to perform some taskes simultanuasly with the main process to evolve your program performence 
and smoothness

miltythreading: is when creat miltiple threads in a single process which helps improve you program performace and speed

race condition: when we miltythreading it may we face data race which mean, several threads trying to access 
a shared data at once and thim may cause undefined behavior of the threads toward that data.

deadlock: deadlock happend when miltiple threads are depending on each other data but all of then locked its 
own ones .

what the process share with a thread:
a thread will inherit all of the (in/itialized) data and the heap and the code segment from the process 
and it will get it own stack and register .

Register:
is a place where the CPU store data that it will need to access it very quichly like process pointer 
which tells what instruction to run now, and so on .
